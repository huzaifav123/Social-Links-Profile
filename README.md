### Useful resources

- [CSS Padding]((https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_padding.asp)) - This helped me in padding for buttons. I really liked the idea of padding instead of width.
- [Border Radius]((https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_border-radius.php)) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand how to make image round. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
